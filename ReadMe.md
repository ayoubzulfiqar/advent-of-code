First Implement then Make it ---*FAST*----

### **Notice:**

As Soon we finish the 25th last day of Advent of Code - We will Make every Implementation of this Repo **Blazingly Fast** and We will Make a Website Where Will user just have to put his input data and **BOOM** with [ HTMX + Templ + Go] If not then (ASTRO [a JS Framework]) and also for those Who just wanna write the own code Of Course they can write in any language they want at first It will be limited but I will do it anyway.
